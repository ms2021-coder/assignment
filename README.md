## Design
This application is a web service that interfaces with a Sqlite3 database to support `get` and `search` operations on a set of person/movie data.
The implementation is divided into packages for web, store, service, and model classes. Dependency injection is used to create instances of a storage
interface that has specific knowledge of a database or other searchable persistent store.

### Class Diagram

#### `net.exercise.model`
Classes that implement immutable value objects.
These are the data types returned from get and search operations.

#### `net.exercise.store`
Definition of the `PersonStore` interface to storage systems for retrieving and searching for `Person` records.
This package also contains an implementation of this interface for Sqlite3.

#### `net.exercise.service`
Service class for retrieving and searching for `Person` records. This is meant to be the main
entry point for integration code that needs to get and search for `Person` records. Dependency injection
is used to provide instances of this class with an instance of `PersonStore` interface.

#### `net.exercise.web`
Main entry point for the web server. `NanoHttpdAdapter` serves as an adapter between the `PersonService` API interface
and the JSON request/response interface of the `NanoHTTPD` library.

## Database Setup
ðŸš¨ Note: There is a `movie-people.db` already setup and ready to go when you
clone this repository. Use the following to re-create the database as necessary.

Re-create and populate the database
```bash
sqlite3 data/movie-people.db < data/bootstrap.sql
```

## Running the Unit Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

## Starting the Web Service

```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/net-exercise-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Using the Web Service
ðŸš¨ Note: The URL path for *get* and *search* requests are `/get` and `/search` respectively.

    }
  ]
}
```

### Search
#### Request Format
```json
